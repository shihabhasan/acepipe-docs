The `ACE`_ pipeline (ACEPipe) currently works with the following genes - SSU (16S/18S) rRNA and fungal ITS.
It consists of a quality control module, amplicon clustering with `QIIME2`_, and taxonomy assignment on representative
OTU sequences using `BLAST`_. The pipeline can run both on the forward (R1) reads and both (R1 & R2) reads.
